I am a french computer scientist and have been a daily lingq student for a year and a half to study Chinese. 

My strength reside in my polyvalence : from UX design to customer training and support, from system administration to responsive design, from ever-learning student to experimented teacher.

I would love to join the Lingq team and contribute to its evolution. My expertise lies on the technical side, but I would also be glad to help on others matters depending on the company's needs, for example with the french course material or the development of Lingq toward the francophone language learners.
